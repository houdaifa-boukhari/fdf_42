# FDF - 42 School Project

## Description

FDF (Fil de Fer) is a 42 School project that involves creating a simple 3D height-map renderer. The program takes a map file as input, where each number represents a height level, and renders it in 3D using the MiniLibX library.

The project aims to introduce students to the basics of graphic programming, including window management, event handling, and basic 3D rendering techniques.

## Features

- **3D Rendering**: Renders a 3D wireframe model from a 2D height map.
- **Zoom and Rotation**: Allows zooming in/out and rotating the model using keyboard and mouse inputs.
- **Color Gradients**: Supports color gradients based on height levels.
- **Custom Maps**: Can read and render custom map files.
